1.1 Background 
In today’s fast-changing fashion world, people want to look unique at every event — be it weddings, corporate events, birthdays, or parties. But buying new clothes for every occasion is impractical and expensive. It also leads to wastage, as many outfits are worn only once and then forgotten.
